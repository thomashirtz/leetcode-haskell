```bash
git clone https://github.com/thomashirtz/haskell-leetcode.git
cd haskell-leetcode
```

## Running Solutions

Each solution is contained in its own Haskell file. Navigate to the specific solution file and compile and run it using GHC.

For example, to run solution 238 on Windows:

```bash
cd solutions
ghc 238.hs -o program && program.exe
```
