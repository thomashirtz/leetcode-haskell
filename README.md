# leetcode-haskell

Welcome to the repository of Haskell solutions for leetcode problems. This project aims to provide clear, efficient, and idiomatic Haskell code for various challenges found on [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/). Whether you are preparing for software engineering interviews or just looking to practice your Haskell programming skills, this repository can serve as a valuable resource.

## Getting Started

This section provides an overview of how to utilize this repository effectively.

### Prerequisites

To run these solutions, you will need:
- [The Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC)](https://www.haskell.org/ghc/)
- [Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/) or [Cabal](https://www.haskell.org/cabal/) to manage Haskell projects and dependencies

### Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/haskell-leetcode.git
cd haskell-leetcode
```

### Running Solutions

Each solution is contained in its own file. To run a solution, navigate to the specific file and use GHC or run it within your project management tool (Stack or Cabal).

Example of script to run a solution on windows (with a `cmd` in `/solutions`):
```
ghc 238.hs -o program && program.exe
```
